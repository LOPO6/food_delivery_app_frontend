THIS IS THE FRONT END TO DO LIST, NOT SURE WHAT TO DO? LOOK HERE!

Components:
    1. (cart/menu) need to add restrictions on user account so that users can't add orders from multiple restaurants
    2. (cart) Users carts should be specific to them, someone signing in from a different account shouldn't see the same items, same thing for users who haven't signed in yet, if a user adds something to their cart, then logs out, they shouldn't still be able to see it
    3. (payment) needs to be implemented, currently no code in there
    4. (courier) need to implement function to fetch present and past order information from the backend, and also implement other backend gets for remainder of info
    5. (restaurant) need to actually get restaurant images added into the backend server so we can test if they will display properly, also need to make filters actually work
    7. (restuarant) need to add the ai searchbar implementation
    8. (checkout) make sure nothing is broken if this is deleted, because it's currently not being used, if nothing breaks, remove it
    9. (general) need to add a proper font for all text, right now generic font is being used.
    10.(menu) need to add a description, star rating, and eta to the restaurants, may need to update the backend model for this one
    11.(menu) need to connect the filter badges to a function that gets the restaurants based on their respective filter



Other stuff:
    1. Need to run non local testing on vercel 
    2. Need to add proper toast notifications
    3. need to make it so that when a user signs up it logs them in to the site and redirects them to the browse page, instead of redirecting them to login


(note, please delete the to do list before final submission)
